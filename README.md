# compatibility_entropy_ranking
Function that demonstrates ranking algorithm based on compatibility and entropy weights.

It ranks any number of decision objects based on some decision attributes. The decision attributes may be of monotone, interval or extreme point type.

This function takes any dataframe, along with information on the types of the various decision attributes in the data, and displays scores for each of the decision object.
